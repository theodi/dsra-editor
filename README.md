# Data Sharing Risk Assessment Editor

The **Data Sharing Risk Assessment Editor** is a web-based tool for loading, editing, and downloading JSON data files related to data sharing risk assessments. It allows users to either load the latest JSON data from a live tool or upload a JSON file from their computer. After making edits, users can download the modified JSON data for further use.

## Features

- **Load JSON from URL**: Load the latest JSON data from a live tool at `https://dsra.theodi.org/json/checkpoints.json`.
- **Upload JSON File**: Upload a JSON file from your computer to edit it within the tool.
- **Edit JSON Data**: Modify the JSON data using a user-friendly form interface, including rich text fields using the Quill WYSIWYG editor.
- **Download JSON Data**: After editing, download the updated JSON data to your computer.

## Warning

**This tool does not save state.** Ensure you download your changes before closing the tool. To continue editing later, you can re-upload the downloaded JSON file.
